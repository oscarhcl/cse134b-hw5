# Oscar Hung Portfolio - CSE 134B HW5

## Changes Made for HW5

### Portfolio Enhancements (Deliverable F)
- **Consolidated Contact Form**: Merged the JavaScript form validation functionality from form-with-js.html into the main contact.html page. This provides a better user experience with real-time validation, character counting for the message field, and visual feedback for invalid inputs. The redundant form-with-js.html and form-no-js.html files were removed to clean up the codebase.
- **Improved Form Styling**: Added CSS for form validation states (valid/invalid), error/success message outputs, and character counter styling that works with both light and dark themes.
